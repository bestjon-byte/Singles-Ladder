## What is the Singles Ladder?

The Tennis Singles Ladder is a competitive ranking system where tennis players can challenge each other to matches and climb up the ladder rankings. Unlike a traditional tournament, you can play matches at your own pace and challenge opponents whenever it suits both of you.

**Key Concept:** Players are ranked by position, with Position 1 being the top player. You can challenge players above you, and if you win, you take their position on the ladder!

---

## Getting Started

Once you've created your account, you'll need to wait for a ladder administrator to add you to the current season's ladder. They have been emailed to let them know.

## How the Ladder System Works

### The Basic Rules

The ladder is simple but strategic:

1. **You can only challenge players ABOVE you** on the ladder (never below)
2. **Normal challenges** let you challenge players 1-2 positions above you
3. **Wildcard challenges** let you challenge ANY player above you (but use a wildcard)
4. **If you win your challenge match**, you take your opponent's position
5. **If you lose**, positions stay the same

### Position Changes Explained

Here's what happens when you WIN a challenge match:

**Example:** You're at Position 5 and challenge Position 2

**Before the match:**
- Position 1: Alice
- Position 2: Bob ← (you're challenging)
- Position 3: Carol
- Position 4: David
- Position 5: You ← (challenger)

**After you WIN:**
- Position 1: Alice (unchanged)
- Position 2: You ← (moved up from 5!)
- Position 3: Bob (shifted down from 2)
- Position 4: Carol (shifted down from 3)
- Position 5: David (shifted down from 4)

**Important Details:**
- You take the challenged player's exact position
- Everyone between your old and new position shifts down by one
- Players above and below this range are unaffected
- If you LOSE, nobody moves - all positions stay the same

### Player Locking

**While you have an active challenge (pending or accepted), you are "locked":**
- You cannot create new challenges
- Other players cannot challenge you
- You'll see an "In Challenge" badge next to your name

**You become unlocked when:**
- The challenge is withdrawn
- The challenge is rejected
- The match is completed and scored

This prevents scheduling conflicts and ensures fair play.

## Understanding Wildcards

### What are Wildcards?

Wildcards are special tokens that allow you to challenge players MORE than 2 positions above you.

**Default allocation:** Each player gets **2 wildcards per season**

### When to Use Wildcards

**Normal Challenge (No wildcard needed):**
- You're Position 7 → Can challenge Positions 5 or 6

**Wildcard Challenge (Requires 1 wildcard):**
- You're Position 7 → Can challenge Positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

### Important Wildcard Rules

1. **Wildcards are reserved when you CREATE a wildcard challenge**
2. **Wildcards are only consumed when the match is COMPLETED** (score submitted)
3. **Wildcards ARE refunded** if:
   - The challenged player rejects your challenge
   - You withdraw the challenge before completion
   - The challenge is cancelled for any reason

4. **Use them strategically!** You only get 2 per season, so:
   - Plan your challenges carefully to maximize opportunities
   - Remember that wildcards are refunded if the match doesn't happen
   - Consider challenging the top players when you're confident in your game

### Checking Your Wildcards

- View remaining wildcards on your dashboard stats card
- The system will warn you if creating a challenge requires a wildcard
- You cannot create a wildcard challenge if you have 0 remaining (including reserved wildcards)
- Reserved wildcards show separately until the match is completed or cancelled

---

## Match Format

All matches are **best of 3 sets**:
- First player to win 2 sets wins the match
- Standard tennis scoring applies
- If you split the first two sets (1-1), you must play a third set

### Third Set Format (Optional)

You can play the third set as:
- **Full Set:** Traditional set to 6 games (with tiebreak at 6-6)
- **Match Tiebreak:** First to 10 points (win by 2)

The app allows you to record either format.

### After the Match

**Either player can submit the score** - you don't need to do it together. The app will automatically:
- Calculate the winner based on sets won
- Update ladder positions (if the challenger won)
- **Consume any reserved wildcard** (if it was a wildcard challenge)
- Send notifications to both players
- Unlock both players for new challenges

---

## Score Validation and Display

### Validation Rules

The app will prevent invalid scores:
- You must enter scores for at least 2 sets
- The winner must have won 2 or more sets
- Scores must be realistic tennis scores (0-7 per set)

### Score Display Format

Scores are shown as: **6-4, 3-6, 7-5**
- Each set separated by commas
- Winner's score shown first in each set
- Tiebreak sets may show as 7-6 or 10-8 (match tiebreak)

---

## Disputing Match Results

### When to Dispute

Dispute a match if:
- The submitted score is incorrect
- You and your opponent disagree on the result
- There was a scoring error during the match

**Note:** Disputes should be rare and used only for genuine errors, not because you're unhappy with the result!

### Dispute Resolution Effects

If the admin changes the score AND the winner changes:
- **Ladder positions are rolled back** to before the match
- **New positions are calculated** based on the corrected result
- **Both players are notified** of the resolution
- **Match history reflects** the corrected score

**Important:** The system fully handles position rollbacks, ensuring the ladder is always accurate even if scores are corrected days later.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Can I challenge someone below me on the ladder?**

A: No. You can only challenge players above you. This is a core rule of ladder systems.

**Q: What if I'm at Position 1?**

A: Congratulations! You can't challenge anyone, but you'll need to defend your position against challenges from below.

**Q: Can I have multiple active challenges?**

A: No. You're "locked" into one challenge at a time. Complete or withdraw your current challenge before starting a new one.

**Q: How many matches can I play per season?**

A: There's no limit! Play as many as you want. More matches = more opportunities to climb.

### Challenge Questions

**Q: What if someone rejects my challenge?**

A: You're unlocked and can challenge someone else. If you used a wildcard, it's returned to you and can be used again.

**Q: Can I withdraw a challenge after it's been accepted?**

A: Yes, but this is discouraged. Be courteous and only withdraw if absolutely necessary (injury, emergency, etc.). If it was a wildcard challenge, your wildcard will be returned.

**Q: What if we can't agree on a date/time?**

A: Unfortunately, the current system doesn't support back-and-forth negotiation. Coordinate offline (WhatsApp/phone) first, then create a challenge with agreed details.

**Q: Do wildcards reset each season?**

A: Yes! You get a fresh allocation of wildcards (default: 2) at the start of each new season.

**Q: When exactly is my wildcard used up?**

A: Your wildcard is reserved when you create the challenge, but only permanently consumed when you complete the match and submit scores. If the challenge is rejected, withdrawn, or cancelled, the wildcard is returned to you.

### Match Questions

**Q: Who brings the tennis balls?**

A: This is not managed by the app. Coordinate with your opponent before the match.

**Q: What if we disagree on the score?**

A: Discuss it immediately after the match. If you can't agree, either player can submit what they believe is correct, and the other can dispute it.

**Q: Can we play a different format (e.g., pro set)?**

A: The app is designed for best-of-3 sets. If you want to play differently, you'll need to convert the result to a 3-set format for submission.

**Q: What if the match is interrupted by weather?**

A: Coordinate with your opponent to reschedule. The challenge stays active until you complete and submit scores.

### Position Questions

**Q: How often can my position change?**

A: Every time you win a challenge match. If you lose, your position stays the same.

**Q: Can the admin manually change positions?**

A: Yes, admins can add/remove players which shifts positions. This is rare and usually done for administrative reasons.

**Q: What if I need to leave the ladder temporarily?**

A: Contact your admin to be removed. You can be added back later, but may start at a different position.

**Q: Do playoff matches affect ladder positions?**

A: No. Only regular season challenge matches change ladder positions. Playoffs are separate.

### Technical Questions

**Q: I didn't get an email notification. What happened?**

A: Check your spam folder, or verify your email notification setting is ON in your profile.

**Q: The app isn't updating. Help!**

A: Try refreshing the page. The app auto-refreshes every 30 seconds, but you can force it manually.

**Q: Can I use the app on my phone?**

A: Yes! The app is fully optimized for mobile devices. Use it at the courts to submit scores right after your match.

**Q: How do I reset my password?**

A: Click "Forgot Password" on the login page and follow the email instructions.
